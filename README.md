# security-jwt
A RESTful API with NodeJS using JWT.

It contains a variety of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) that allow a user to access a restricted API/resource.

A user can register and log in using a resource (API) and have access to the contacts service. The API uses bcrypt and JSON Web Token to handle the password hashing and the token for the user.
